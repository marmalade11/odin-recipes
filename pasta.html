<h5><p><i> Delicious autentic italian Carbonara.</p></i></h5>


<h3>Ingredients </h3>


<ul>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Guanciale</li>
  <li>Parmigiano</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Pepper</li>
  <li>Spaghetti</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Steps </h3>


<ol>

  <li>Batons Cut the guanciale into thick batons. Biting through the golden brown crust into meaty bits of salty guanciale is part of the awesomeness that is carbonara!</li>
  <li>Finely grate the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino. I use a microplane one of can’t-live-without kitchenware items!</li>
  <li>Sauce – Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
  <li>Cook pasta – Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through. </li>
  <li>Reserve pasta cooking water – Just before draining, scoop out one cup of pasta cooking water. Then drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
  <li>Cook guanciale until golden while the pasta is cooking. You don’t need any oil, the guanciale will fry in its own fat.</li>
  <li>Transfer into sauce bowl – Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is gold!</li>
  <li>Mix vigorously with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch as the watery pale yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce.</li>
